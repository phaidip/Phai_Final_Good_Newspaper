    <h1 class="aboutTitle"> About The Good Newspaper</h1>
    <p>The Good Newspaper is a vision, a dream and an ambition of London based Wed Developer/Designer - Phai Dip.</p><br>
    <h2>The Vision</h2>
    <p>This vision was first envisaged through the daily commute to work of an average working class person, the same miserable faces at the bus stop,the dreary journey on the train, picking up the same newspaper which is full of bad press. We all know that the bad press is the story that usually drives more attention and readers, but don't everyone every now and again just don't want to hear about bad news? Don't you every want something up-lifting on that dreaded journey to work? That, is why the Good Newspaper has been published.</p><br>
    <h2>The Dream</h2>
    <p>Although the Good Newspaper is currently only avialable at in it's digital platform, the dream is to publish the Good Newspaper across all of London, and gradually spreading lot's of good news to the whole world. </p><br>
    <h2>The Ambition</h2>
    <p>Don't get it wrong, we are NOT competing with your usual preferred choice of newspaper, we are merely providing you with the option of just reading about good news. We are not aiming to be everyones first choice or even only choice, we are here when you need a bit of cheering up.</p><br>
